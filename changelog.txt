	  Trixter and to the use of the "Multiple Block Read" card commands.
	- Write speed increased thanks to unrolling and the use of "Multiple Block
	  Write" card commands. (max seen: 35 kB/s on an MMC card)
	- sdcart.sys : Display the type of card detected (MMC or SD) during media check
	- sdpart.com : Now display the geometry the SD-Cart BIOS will use for the
	  card. (Computed from the card size)
	- sdpart.com : When displaying partition information, also show the CHS numbers
	  as is, accompanied by which block they correspond to, given the geometry
	  the SD-Cart BIOS will use.
	- BIOS: The geometry to use is now determined at runtime, based on the size the
	  card reports.

	Versions: sdpart.com v0.2, sdcart.sys v0.10, bios v0.10
