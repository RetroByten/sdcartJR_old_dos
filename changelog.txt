Release v05 : Future
    - BIOS : Improvements for co-existing with another hard drive BIOS. By
	  default, the SD-Cart JR becomes the last drive in the systesm. (tested
	  only with JR-IDE)
	- Add an options menu to allow non-default behavior, such as:
	  - Installing the SD-Cart JR as the first drive in a system with
	    another hard drive BIOS (existing hard drive becomes second hard
		drive and remains accessible)
	  - Installing as single drive (other hard drive not accessible)
	  - Not installing the SD-Cart BIOS.

	Versions: sdpart.com v0.4, sdcart.sys v0.3, bios v0.40

Release v04 : 2020-12-29
	Compatiblity improvements and fixes.

    - sdpart.com / sdcart.sys : Add retries reading MBR (fixes some
	  non-working cards)
	- sdcart.sys : Use CMD13 (Send Status) instead of CMD10 (Read CID) to
	  detect card changes (Solves occasional errors with some cards)
	- sdpart.com : Add more error checking, display card info before reading
	  MBR, so at least some info is displayed if the read fails.
	- BIOS : When reading a sector fails, it is retried at least once. (Fixes
	  issues with some cards where drive C: would not be available)

	Versions: sdpart.com v0.4, sdcart.sys v0.3, bios v0.30

Release v03 : 2020-12-08
    - Add support for block-addressed cards (ie. > 2GB)
	- Implement >32M partition support in sdcart.sys
	- Add a "low memory" version of sdcart.sys (sdcartl.sys). Sacrifices speed
	  for using only approx. 3kb of memory instead of approx. 9kb.
	- sdpart.com : Display card information before reading the MBR

	Versions: sdpart.com v0.3, sdcart.sys v0.2, bios v0.20

Release v02 : 2020-11-30
	- Read speed increased from 33 kB/s to 43 kB/s, thanks to suggestions from
	  Trixter and to the use of the "Multiple Block Read" card commands.
	- Write speed increased thanks to unrolling and the use of "Multiple Block
	  Write" card commands. (max seen: 35 kB/s on an MMC card)
	- sdcart.sys : Display the type of card detected (MMC or SD) during media check
	- sdpart.com : Now display the geometry the SD-Cart BIOS will use for the
	  card. (Computed from the card size)
	- sdpart.com : When displaying partition information, also show the CHS numbers
	  as is, accompanied by which block they correspond to, given the geometry
	  the SD-Cart BIOS will use.
	- BIOS: The geometry to use is now determined at runtime, based on the size the
	  card reports.

	Versions: sdpart.com v0.2, sdcart.sys v0.10, bios v0.10

Release v01 : 2020-11-17
